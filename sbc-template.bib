abstract = {Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the "smart city" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the "smart city." We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.},

abstract = {We describe an automated apparatus that can be used to investigate the effects of defeat in hamsters. It consists of a covered alleyway that leads to a box, or arena, where hamsters can be kept separate or allowed to fight. The alleyway is divided into seven equal-sized chambers. Low-power lasers and laser detectors are used to keep track of a hamster's position in the alleyway. A CFL flood lamp placed over the chamber farthest from the arena generates a light gradient in the alleyway that engenders in the subjects a preference for the darker chambers near the arena. A computer automatically records the interruption of the laser beams and yields three measures: average position, the frequency of visits to each chamber, and the frequency of changes in direction of travel in each chamber. The results of a pilot study indicated that when a dominant hamster was placed behind a screened gate in the arena and a subordinate hamster was placed in the alleyway, the subordinate maintained a significantly greater distance from the dominant than did a nondefeated hamster. The subordinate hamster also changed its direction of travel more frequently than did the nondefeated hamster. The results suggest that conditioned fear was elicited in the defeated hamster by proximity to the dominant hamster, an effect that is consistent with published results in which the data were recorded manually or by using commercially available event-tracking software.},

abstract = {Recent changes in service environments have changed the preconditions of their production and con- sumption. These changes include unbundling services from production processes, growth of the information-rich economy and society, the search for creativity in service production and consumption and continuing growth of digital technologies. These contextual changes affect city governments because they provide a range of infrastructure and welfare services to citizens. Concepts such as ‘smart city', ‘intelligent city' and ‘knowledge city' build new horizons for cities in undertaking their challenging service functions in an increasingly cost-conscious, competitive and environmentally oriented setting. What is essential in practically all of them is that they paint a picture of cities with smooth information processes, facilitation of creativ- ity and innovativeness, and smart and sustainable solutions promoted through service platforms. This article discusses this topic, starting from the nature of services and the new service economy as the context of smart local public ser- vices. On this basis, we build an overall framework for understanding the basic forms and dimensions of smart public services. The focus is on conceptual systematisation of the key dimensions of smart services and the conceptual modelling of smart service platforms through which digital technology is increasingly embedded in social creativity. We provide examples of real-life smart service applications within the European context.},

abstract = {Distributed controllers have been proposed for Software Defined Networking to address the issues of scalability and reliability that a centralized controller suffers from. One key limitation of the distributed controllers is that the mapping between a switch and a controller is statically configured, which may result in uneven load distribution among the controllers. To address this problem, we propose ElastiCon, an elastic distributed controller architecture in which the controller pool is dynamically grown or shrunk according to traffic conditions and the load is dynamically shifted across controllers. We propose a novel switch migration protocol for enabling such load shifting, which conforms with the Openflow standard. We also build a prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of our design.},

abstract = {Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) architecture is expected to evolve into a horizontal model containing various open systems, integrated environments, and platforms. However, not much research effort has been devoted to developing architectures for horizontal IoT solutions so far. This paper presents an IoT architecture based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN). In this architecture, devices, gateways, and data are open and programmable to IoT application developers and service operators. Moreover, IoT data provision and interoperability are supported at different levels. We present an implementation of the proposed architecture. Our implementation shows that the proposed architecture enables rapid creation of IoT applications by reusing ready applications and data. The measurement and evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture.},

@article{Stentz1988,
abstract = {Network reconfiguration in distribution systems is realized by changing the status of sectionalizing switches, and is usually done for loss reduction or for load balancing in the system. In this paper, general formulation and solution methods are proposed for these problems. In network reconfiguration for loss reduction, the solution involves a search over relevant radial configurations. To aid the search, two approximate power flow methods with varying degree of accuracy have been developed. The methods are computationally attractive and in general give conservative estimates of loss reduction. For load balancing, a load balance index is defined and it is shown that the proposed solution method for loss reduction can also be used for load balancing. Test results are included to show the performance of the proposed method.},
